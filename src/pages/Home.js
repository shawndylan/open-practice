          <h3>A Profession In Crisis</h3>
          <br></br>
          <p>The architectural profession's relationship to the broader social and political discourse is eroding. In the last decade or so, we have seen drastic shifts in architectural practice as it relates to global events such as the 2008 financial crisis, and more recently the Covid-19 pandemic. Traditional practice structures based on neo-liberal global markets fail to meet the socio-political challenges of the 21st-century. How can architects rectify relevance in contributing to social issues?</p>

          <h3>Collaborative Models</h3>
          <br></br>
          <p>New models for architectural practice have emerged as a result of changing economic conditions. These practices have taken on structures which rely on horizontal collaboration between people and groups rather than traditionally vertically-managed office structures. Collectives, cooperatives, platforms, and networks are some of the examples that exist.</p>

          <br></br>
          <p>The discourse of professional practice is often delivered through the lens of corporate, large-scale firms which results in a one-dimensional approach to architectural practice. New types of practices including: collectives, cooperatives, platforms and networks demand new modes of professional practice.</p>
