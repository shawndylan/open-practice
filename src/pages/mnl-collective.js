            <p>A collective is a group of people who come together under a shared interest. This structure tends to fluctuate in size depending on the needs of the practice. This type of practice structure tends to be more horizontally organized, where there is a lack of a visible hierarchy among members. Collectives generally offer equal power in decision making, equal status and equal financial compensation.</p>
